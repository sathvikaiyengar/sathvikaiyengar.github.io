Hi! I am a recent graduate from Northeastern University, where I majored in Computer Science and Physics with a minor in Mathematics. I am passionate about utilizing machine learning and software development to solve complex problems across industries.

With hands-on experience in startups and research environments across the U.S. and Europe, I enjoy building meaningful, data-driven applications - whether it's modeling astrophysical simulations or creating intuitive software tools.


Feel free to explore my current projects and professional journey.
